## Local development

You'll need foreman installed globally:

`gem install -g foreman`

Rename `Procfile.dev.default` to `Procfile.dev`, and replace `ABSOLUTE_PATH_TO_PROJECT` with the absolute path to the project's folder.

Use https://mailcatcher.me/ for emails in development mode. Simply run `gem install mailcatcher` then `mailcatcher` to get started.
